# OpenSea's NFT Empire

</div>

<br>

## Overview & Origin

* OpenSea was founded in 2017 by Devin Finzer and Alex Atallah [2].

* The founders socialized on Discord communities along with fellow early adopters of non-fungible tokens where they noticed a need for a robust and user-friendly marketplace. Shortly after the creation of *CryptoKitties* - an early, popular digital asset project - Finzer and Atallah set out to create OpenSea [1]. Inspired by reaction of the crypto-community's reaction to *CryptoKitties*, they knew they had to create a marketplace where members of their Discord communities and future NFT enthusiasts could openly exchange their coveted digital possessions[1].

* OpenSea raised **$2.1M** in 2018 during a pre-seed round hosted by Y Combinator [1]. To date, the company raised a total of **$423M** from Andreessen Horowiz, Mark Cuban, and other investors [2].

## Business Activities

* Prior to OpenSea, an NFT creator had to host a website to display each of their pieces, handle the transfer of the NFT to the buyer after a sale, and every action inbetween. The revolutionary platform allowed NFT creators to list their pieces for sale in an open-auction style immediately after development and provided in-built support for different wallets, currencies, and virtual displays.

* OpenSea's intended customers make up three categories: NFT creators, collectors, and traders who bring in revenue for the company through a **2.5%** fee on NFT sales. While it is difficult to guage the number of these customers exist worldwide, an important note is that the value transferred through NFT marketplaces peaked in April 2022 at impressive total of just over **$2.5B** [5].

* Being the longest operating and most well known of all NFT marketplaces, OpenSea's brand is familiar to anyone who has researched the NFT space. Especially important to a storefront or catalog product such as itself, OpenSea's wide audience and broad capture of the NFT marketplace marketshare makes it uniquely attractive for token buyers and sellers alike. Its solid userbase provides a huge number of NFTs for buyers choose from as well as plenty of eager bidders for those who have a piece to sell.

* OpenSea allows users to list tokens that reside on one of their supported blockchains: Etherium, Polygon, Klaytn, and Solana [6]. To add useful information to their NFT catalog, OpenSea also uses software provided by Alchemy - another blockchain power player. Alchemy provides easy access to blockchain data so that OpenSea can display stats about an NFT such as its previous owners and the artist behind the work [2].


## Landscape

* OpenSea is leveraging cryptocurrency blockchains to provide its users access to the innovative and rapidly growing Non-Fungible Token space.

* NFT technology has seen rapid growth in recent years which has been funded by some well-known investors. Early NFTs mostly consisted of unique, programmaticly-generated images which can be collected, sold, and traded, similar to physical trading cards. The concept has since been expanded to more complex virtual objects such as ownable areas in virtual worlds which act like a deed to a real-life plot of land. The proponents of NFTs says that soon, every physical object one owns may soon have its virtual counterpart that is store on the blockchain.

* Since NFTs have gained popularity, many companies have tried to emulate OpenSea's success by opening their own NFT marketplaces, some of which are backed by powerful, venture capital-backed crypto exchanges. Among the top marketplace-only service are Looksrare, Superrare, and Rarible. However, exchanges such as Crypto.com, Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, FTX and others have joined the party and opened their own NFT marketplaces built-in to their exchange platforms. 


## Results

* The OpenSea's rise to NFT domination is a testament to the strong leadership and patient management of its founders Finzer and Atallah. The company handled its first few years with just seven employees up until the end of 2020 [3]. This allowed the company to survive on capital and silently fine tune its platform for the wave of traffic which flooded its servers as NFTs gained paved their way into pop-culture during the following year.

* Since inception, OpenSea has been able to capture an impressive share of the NFT resale and first-mint market. When considering the value of NFTs transferred between users across all NFT marketplaces, OpenSea *rarely* provides **less** than **50%** of the total volume at any point since January 2020 [4]. Even more impressive, during certain months their contribution reaches over **90%** and currently stands at a staggering **99.8%** [4]. "While OpenSea processed $94.8 million in NFT sales volume for the entirety of 2020, it is on track to surpass $27.5 billion in volume for 2021, a 30,000% increase year over year" [3].

## Recommendations

* Although OpenSea has business metrics that few companies can rival, the platform is not without its weak points. The competing marketplaces are still in their infacy, but with plenty of capital behind them, the competitors may dethrone OpenSea should it get complacent.

* High Etherium gas fees and the 2.5% commission that OpenSea takes may push some customers to other platforms which have no fees and offer other products on other blockchains products. OpenSea has recently added more chains as well, but some are still being built out, and ETH-chained NFTs still make up a large portion of their sales.

* Another reason customers may look to other marketplaces is the issue of centralization. OpenSea's platform is still completely centralized - meaning their is no ability for users to dictate its policies or corporate actions [3]. This might seem like an unusual request of the user, but blockchain enthusiasts believe this aspect is a key component to blockchain products.
